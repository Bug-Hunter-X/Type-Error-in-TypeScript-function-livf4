This repository contains a simple example of a type error in TypeScript. The error occurs because the greeter function expects a string argument, but an array of strings is passed instead. The solution involves checking the type of the argument and handling the case where an array is passed.  This example is useful for understanding TypeScript type checking and error handling.
